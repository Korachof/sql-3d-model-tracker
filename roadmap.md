- [x] Add procedure for tags
- [x] Add procedure for model print records
- [x] Junction procedure for adding tags to models
- [x] Read procedure for models
- [x] Read procedure for getting tags assigned to specific models
- [x] Read procedure for printers
- [x] Read procedure for tags
- [x] Read procedure for model print logs
- [x] Read procedure for getting print logs associated with a specific model
- [ ] Read procedure for getting print logs associated with a specific printer
- [ ] Read procedure for getting models by tag
- [ ] Read procedure to get model details (model info, associated tags, past print logs involving that model)
- [ ] Update procedure for models
- [ ] Update procedure for printers
- [ ] Update procedure for tags
- [ ] Update procedure for print logs
- [ ] Delete procedure for models

- [ ] Document procedure inputs and output formats

## Phase 2: Usability & Query Enhancements

- [ ] Create additional views (e.g. print stats, tag filters)
- [ ] Add sorting and pagination helpers
- [ ] Implement licensing filter logic
- [ ] Add indexing strategy and performance checks

## Stretch Goals

- [ ] Track user or print location metadata
- [ ] Build lightweight UI or admin dashboard
- [ ] Export recent prints to JSON or CSV
- [ ] Hook in other sources (e.g. Printables, Cults3D)
- [ ] Integrate thumbnail imports for a visually rich UI
